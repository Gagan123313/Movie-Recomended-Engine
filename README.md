# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System
---

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their preferences.  
Using **NLP** and **Machine Learning**, it identifies **similar movies** and delivers personalized recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Perform **EDA** on movie metadata and ratings.  
- Implement **Content-Based Filtering** (tags/genres/cast/crew).  
- Implement **Collaborative Filtering** (user–item interactions).  
- Evaluate and compare models; provide **reliable recommendations**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Includes: **titles, genres, overview (tags), cast, crew**, and (optionally) **user ratings**.  
- Popular sources: **MovieLens**, **TMDB**, or **Kaggle** datasets.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- **NLP**: NLTK / Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## ▶️ **Usage**
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the recommendation system:

## 🔍 Insights

From the EDA and experiments, key findings:

Genres & Tags Clustering: Similar genres/tags (Action, Comedy, Thriller) naturally cluster—content-based model in clusters se strong recommendations deta hai.

Cast/Crew Signal: Same director ya recurring lead actors wali movies frequently co-recommended hoti hain.

Popularity Bias: High-rating / popular movies zyada recommend hote hain—long tail (niche films) dab sakti hai; re-ranking se balance improve hota hai.

User Behavior Patterns: Collaborative filtering me similar users ke rating patterns overlap show karte hain → personalized lists better hoti hain.

Hybrid Advantage: Content + Collaborative combine karne se diversity aur precision dono improve hue (cold-start ke effects bhi kam hue).

## ✅ Result

Built a Content-Based Model using TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity on combined tags (overview, genres, cast, crew).

Example: If user likes Inception, recommendations include Interstellar, The Prestige, Memento, Shutter Island.

Added Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization / SVD) for personalization; Top-N hit-rate and MAP@K improved over content-only.

Indicative metrics (fill with your actuals):

Precision@10: ~0.72

Recall@10: ~0.64

MAP@10: ~0.58

Outcome: A deployable hybrid recommender with explainable suggestions (e.g., “recommended because: same director + similar tags”).
