# Default Risk Analysis Prediction

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Default Risk Analysis Prediction project. This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of loan default. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of customer and loan information, this project aims to provide an accurate prediction system that can be used by financial institutions to make more informed lending decisions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the raw data for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Notebooks with detailed visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the key factors influencing loan default.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of several classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) to find the best-performing model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics for evaluating model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.
- **Inference Pipeline:** A streamlined process to take new data and generate default risk predictions.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model building.
- `models/`: Trained model files (e.g., `.pkl`, `.h5`).
- `requirements.txt`: A list of all required libraries to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language.
- **Libraries:**
    - `pandas` & `numpy` for data manipulation.
    - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models.
    - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization.
    - (Add any other specific libraries you used, like `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, etc.)
